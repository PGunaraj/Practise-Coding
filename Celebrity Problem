#using stack
1. push all elem to stack
2. pop top 2 elem A and B from stack
3. if A knows B, push B. else push A
4. repeat 2,3 until 1 elem is left out - x
5. traverse elem array once and find if each elem knows x and x doesn't know anyone. 
6. If yes, return YES. when one elem doesn't know x or x knows someone, then return NO.

#using 2 pointers
l=0
r=n-1
while l<r:
  if elem[l] knows elem[n-1]:
    l+=1
  else:
    r-=1
for i in range(n):
  if elem[i]!=elem[l] and (not elem[i] knows elem[l] or elem[l] knows elem[i]):
    return "NO"
return "YES"
